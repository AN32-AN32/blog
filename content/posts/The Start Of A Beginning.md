So, hey, this is my first blog or to say, my first time writing something that is in my mind! The whole idea of starting a blog came from a video by *[NetworkChuck](https://youtu.be/dnE7c0ELEH8?si=nYCjzwAAECGpRofv)*, where he talked about the second brain, and something about sharing information with others. 

I always wanted to share information with others, and I tried, I started 4 youtube channels (not simulatenously), but making videos is too much work and I also have a shitty computer (actual reason; lack of persistence). And before youtube, I tried to create blogs using *Blogger*, where I would talk about economy, uh uh... Nevermind. In this blog site, I hope to share the knowledge I pickup along the way and my thought process when solving a problem. **AND BE CONSISTENT!**

## Technical Aspect

So the tehnincal aspect, is not so complex, I used the same pipeline (copied) showed by *NetworkChuck*, where the blogs are written in *[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)*, then we use *[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)* to convert the blog from markdown format to *HTML*. Then, upload the HTML blog to *Github*, and host it using *Github Pages*. All of these steps are done using a shell script, so I can technically say, **"I upload my blog to my site with just a single command (`./updateBlog`)"**.

Here's the pipeline:![Image Description](/blog/images/Screenshot%20from%202024-11-28%2018-15-24.png)

## What Did I Learn

Just by following *NetworkChuck*'s video, I learnt about *Hugo*, some new github commands and most importantly, I learnt about Github pages, which I learnt by my own (I am proud).

Also let me tell you my rookie mistake, while learning Github pages. I first searched on *Google*, there came a lot of writeups and blogs, and every one of them said that you were supposed to go to `settings > pages` and then select which branch you want to deploy. My stupid eyes, did not catch the difference between, **Project Settings** and **Account Settings**. So you guessed it right? 1 Hour of pain staking debugging or searching, and finally I realised that I was supposed to go to Project Settings. DAMN!!!

Sometimes I think IT is about learning from mistakes, I guess!

That's it for my first blog, today I created my blogs pipeline (or copied) where I would easily be able to upload my blogs with a **single command**. I hope this blog was not a *Yappathon*, cause I don't know what the hell, I am talking about, so see you next time!
